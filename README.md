Given a dataset of movies, Create a model that predicts the expected revenue and expected rating of future movies.
We tried to solve it using Neural network and Random forest.
The Random forest achieved +-50,000,000 error on the expected revenue, and 0.5 error on the expected rating.
The Neural Network was a little bit less accurate so we chose to go on with the Random Forest. 
(A committe was an option too, but the results of the Random Forest by itself were good enough)
